# Growlers Seattle Local Commerce Site

The site is to serve as a business website for a private dog park, Growlerz Seattle. The site has been deployed as a proof-of-concept for the owners, and will receive a final approval before production. The need for the site, is a simple interface between the business and visitors. The owners needed a easy way of adding events, changing prices, notifying customers, and updatng hours that their current provider Wix does not.

## User Stores

- As a user of the Growlerz Seattle commerce site
  - I would like the app to inform me of business details, products, and relevant information. In order of priority:
  1.  Product and Pricing
  2.  Things to know before visiting
  3.  Events and Food truck
  4.  Taproom
  5.  Hours and Location
  6.  Park Rules and Pricing
  7.  Misc
  - I would like the app to be responsive on both mobile and desktop.
  - I would like to easily find
  - I would like to know if small dogs are separated from large dogs.
  - Would like to see the layout of the dog park and photos.
  - Would like to know are humans welcome (with/without dogs?)

Acceptance Criteria

1. The website is responsible for mobile and desktop

## Tasks

- Create React Router

## Obstacles

- Started using Materials IU to cut down work on effects. Took a long time to figure out, but researching online, I realized the react-router-dom's Link added an underline to the Material UI's button. I was targeting the button, but instead had to target the Link to remove the underline.
- I had problems with deploying to Netilfy. In the future I'll deploy with an empty project, then constant deploys. To remedy this project, I created a new one and moved components by components.
- I need to be better planning CSS

## Things Learned

- I dislike the amount of time and work that goes into design.
- Using css white-space: pre-line to format JSON text.
- Defining global variables for CSS
